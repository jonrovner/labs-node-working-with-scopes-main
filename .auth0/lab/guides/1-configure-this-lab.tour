Both of these will need to be configured on your Auth0 Labs tenant. \n\nIf you've gone through the previous labs, you may already have these in place. \n\nRegardless, we'll go ahead and run a few commands to ensure everything is set up appropriately.\n\n1. #### Click [here](command:auth0.lab.configure) to leverage the Auth0 extension for vscode and the CLI to set the lab up. \n1. #### Click [here](command:workbench.action.files.saveAll) to save this progress."
